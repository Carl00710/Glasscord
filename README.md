# A fragile theme for Discord
<small>idk how to show an image without basically doxxing my whole friend list or chats but I'll figrue out a way one day...</small>
Well... this theme is copypasted from this "animated glass theme" on [VSThemes](https://vsthemes.org/en/skins/discord/68455-animated-glass.html), but I tweaked some things.
- First of all, when zooming on an image there's not a gray-ish screen anymore, but instead the default darker one;
- This should have probably been the first instead, a new wallpaper stolen from [here](https://wallpapers-clan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/starfall-night-sky-mountains-aesthetic-gif-preview-desktop-wallpaper.gif) (it looked cool), but it is easily editable by switching up the link at the bottom of everything;
- A slight gradient when in call with friends;
## WARNING!!!
This theme comes automatically with **Comic Sans** pre-installed.

You can still change it by changing the font used in the code (near the top), but still.

# How to use:
If you have either [Betterdiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) or [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/), you can just go in their respective settings, click "show theme folder" and then put the .css file inside of it.

# Small list of stuff I would like to add:
- More tweaks so that it can be actually considered unique and not just copy-pasted code;
- A better font than COMIC SANS
- Idk how that will ever work, but a way to use Wallpaper Engine Wallpapers on it (a friend suggested that)
